# About
refined-h264ify is a browser extension available for Firefox and Chromium based browsers, designed to improve your online video experience by blocking the VP8/VP9 codecs on YouTube. Instead, the extension enables the use of the widely supported H264 codec, which is hardware-decoded by many devices on the market.

In addition to the core functionality, refined-h264ify introduces several new features, such as manual blocking of H264, VP8, VP9, and AV1 codecs, as well as 60fps video support. By default, the extension blocks everything except for H264 and 60fps video, allowing you to enjoy a smoother and more efficient video playback experience.

It currently only supports YouTube.
